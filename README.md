# npm_vue_demo

This is a simple demo for creating vue project using npm (rather than directly introduce `vue.min.js`), and using the "single-file component (SFC)" style.

Each step in the following (git commands are omitted) corresponds to one commit of the git repo, so you can see the changes after each step.
